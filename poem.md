Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,

And sory I could not travel both

And be one travler, long I stood

And looked down one as far as I could

To where it bnt in the undrgrowth;



Then took the othr, as just as fair,

And havin perhaps the beter claim

Because it was grasy and wanted wear,

Though as for that the pasing there

Had worn them realy about the saem,



And boath that morning equaly lay

In laeves no step had trodden black.

Oh, I kept the first for anothre day!

Yet knowin how way leads on to way

I dobted if I should evr come beck.
