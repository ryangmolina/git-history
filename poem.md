Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,

And sory I could not travel both

And be one travler, long I stood

And looked down one as far as I could

To where it bnt in the undrgrowth;



Then took the other, as just as fair,

And having perhaps the better claim

Because it was greasy and wanted wear,

Though as for that the passing there

Had worn them really about the same,



And boath that morning equaly lay

In laeves no step had trodden black.

Oh, I kept the first for anothre day!

Yet knowin how way leads on to way

I dobted if I should evr come beck.
